# Eliza Chatbot in Assembly

<p>I rewrote the eliza.bas QuickBasic64 source code into MASM Assembly. The project contains the following modules:</p>

<p>eliza.asm - The main source file that runs the program loop. This is still in development.
<br>console.asm - Processes input/output to the console.
<br>keyword.asm - Stores and retrieves keywords that Eliza responds to in the user's input.
<br>reply.asm - Stores and retrieves the replies Eliza uses to respond back to the user. This is still in development. This is still in development.
<br>conjugate.asm - Stores and processes string conjugations needed to help Eliza have more natural speech in her responses. This is still in development.
<br>string.asm - A library of string manipulation functions used by other modules to process the user's input and form Eliza's response. This is still in development.</p>

<p>You can also view the original eliza.bas QuickBasic64 source code in the Eliza directory.</p>
